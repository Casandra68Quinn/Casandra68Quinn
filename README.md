## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a junior full-stack developer building hobby projects using the MERN stackâ€”MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. This repository is a collection of my hands-on learning, where I bring ideas to life by building full-stack applications from the ground up.

Working with the MERN stack allows me to explore both front-end and back-end development in a cohesive JavaScript ecosystem. On the front end, Iâ€™m learning to build responsive, interactive interfaces with React, using component-based design and state management to create smooth user experiences. On the back end, Iâ€™m focused on building RESTful APIs with Express and Node.js, handling routing, middleware, and connecting to MongoDB for storing and managing data.

These projects reflect my passion for building real-world applications while sharpening my coding skills. From simple to-do apps and dashboards to more complex systems like authentication flows and CRUD-based platforms, each project is a step forward in becoming more confident as a full-stack developer.

Iâ€™m also learning about best practices like code organization, using environment variables, managing Git workflows, and writing clean, readable code. As I grow, Iâ€™m incorporating tools like React Router, Mongoose, and Postman to test and improve my development process.

This repository is part sandbox, part portfolioâ€”showcasing where I am and where Iâ€™m headed. If you're also learning the MERN stack or have tips, feedback, or collaboration ideas, Iâ€™d love to hear from you. Feel free to explore the projects, raise issues, or contribute.

Thanks for stopping byâ€”and hereâ€™s to learning full-stack development, one project at a time.
